> Fetch properties of your project's `package.json` at compile time.

pkg.macro allows you to turn `pkg(["name", "version"])` into
`{ name: "your-package", version: "1.0.0" }` as a build time constant.

## installation

```sh
yarn add --dev pkg.macro
```

Make sure you also have [Babel][babel] and [babel-plugin-macros][babel-plugin-macros]
installed:

```sh
yarn add --dev @babel/cli @babel/core babel-plugin-macros
```

... and configured with Babel:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: [],
  plugins: ["babel-plugin-macros"]
}
```

## usage

```js
import pkg from "pkg.macro"

const props = pkg([
  "name",
  "version",
  "scripts.test",
  ["dependencies", "some-package"]
])
```

The above is transformed to:

```js
const props = {
  name: "your-package",
  version: "1.0.0",
  scripts: {
    test: "test-script"
  },
  dependencies: {
    "some-package": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```
